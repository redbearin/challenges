Given an array of integers, find the pair of adjacent elements that have the largest product and return that product.

Examples
adjacentProduct([3, 6, -2, -5, 7, 3] ) ➞ 21

adjacentProduct([5, 6, -4, 2, 3, 2, -23]) ➞ 30

adjacentProduct([0, -1, 1, 24, 1, -4, 8, 10]) ➞ 80

Notes
Each array has at least two elements.
