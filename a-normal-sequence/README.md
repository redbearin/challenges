Consider a sequence where the first two numbers are 0 and 1 and the next number of the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers modulo three.

Create a function that finds the nth element of the sequence.

Examples
normalSequence(1) ➞ 0

normalSequence(2) ➞ 1

normalSequence(3) ➞ 1
// (0+1)%3 = 1

normalSequence(20) ➞ 2

Notes
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^19
