We all love a little bargain.

Your function will get a price, and a load of discounts. Your job is to write the function so that it calculates the maximum discount.

The price is a Number.
The load of discounts is a string like: 15%, 8, 50%.
So, percentages, with %, and amounts, without %.
You have to think about the order of applying the discounts.
Round the output amount to the nearest hundreth.
Output a Number.
Examples
discount(64, "50%, 50%") ➞ 16
// You have to reduce with 50% twice.

discount(24, "20, 2") ➞ 2
// You have to subtract 20 and 2.

discount(20, "10%, 10") ➞ 8
// You have to reduce with 10% and subtract 10.
