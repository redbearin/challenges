Given a string s formed from zeros and ones, return the maximum score after splitting the string into two non-empty substrings (left and right).

The score after splitting a string is the number of zeros in the left substring plus the number of ones in the right substring.

Examples
maxScore("00111") ➞ 5

maxScore("1111") ➞ 3

maxScore("01001") ➞ 4

maxScore("010101010101010101") ➞ 10
