A number is considered slidey if for every digit in the number, the next digit from that has an absolute difference of one. Check the examples below.

Examples
isSlidey(123454321) ➞ true

isSlidey(54345) ➞ true

isSlidey(987654321) ➞ true

isSlidey(1123) ➞ false

isSlidey(1357) ➞ false

Notes
A number cannot slide properly if there is a "flat surface" (example #4), or has gaps (example #5).
All single digit numbers can be considered slidey numbers!
