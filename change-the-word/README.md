Given a string, reverse its order, change lowercase letters to uppercase and increment uppercase letters by one (e.g. A becomes B, C becomes D, Z becomes A).

Examples
changeString("ApPle") ➞ "ELQPB"

changeString("draGON") ➞ "OPHARD"

changeString("ZebrA") ➞ "BRBEA"

Notes
Remember capital "Z" becomes "A".
