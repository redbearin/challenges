Through the Grid
How many ways are there to navigate through a grid (w * h)?

Suppose you're on a 4 × 6 grid, and want to go from the bottom left to the top right. How many different paths can you take? Avoid backtracking, you can only move right or up.

Create a function that takes width and height and returns the amount of possibilities.

Examples
gridPos([1, 1]) ➞ 2

gridPos([6, 4]) ➞ 210

gridPos([5, 5]) ➞ 252
