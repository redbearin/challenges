Consider the equation ax-b=bx-3a+4 where a and b are constants. Create a function that takes numbers a and b as arguments, and returns the solution of the equation.

If the equation does not have a solution, return "No solution".
If any number satisfies the equation, return "Any number".
Examples
solve(1, 2) ➞ -3.0

solve(-4, -6) ➞ 5.0

solve(4, 1) ➞ -2.333

Notes
