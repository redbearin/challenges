Create a function that takes a number num and returns its double factorial.

Examples
doubleFactorial(0) ➞ 1

doubleFactorial(2) ➞ 2

doubleFactorial(9) ➞ 945
// 9*7*5*3*1 = 945

doubleFactorial(14) ➞ 645120

Notes
Assume all input values are greater than or equal to -1.
Try to solve it with recursion.
Double factorial is not the same as factorial * 2.
