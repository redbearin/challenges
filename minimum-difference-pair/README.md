Given an array of numbers, return the pair of numbers that give the minimum absolute difference. Return the pair as an array, sorted in ascending order. If multiple pairs have the same difference, return the pair with the smallest sum.

Examples
minDifferencePair([40, 16, 8, 17, 15]) ➞ [15, 16]
// [15, 16] has smaller sum than [16, 17]

minDifferencePair([1, -31, -27, -18, -48, -15, -11, -34]) ➞ [-34, -31]

minDifferencePair([0, 2, 35, 42, 45, 14, -6, -1]) ➞ [-1, 0]

minDifferencePair([32, 33, 4, 6, 48, 18, 20, -7, -4, 31]) ➞ [31, 32]

Notes
There will be no duplicate numbers in the array.
