Imagine a circle and two squares: a smaller and a bigger one. For the smaller one, the circle is a circumcircle and for the bigger one, an incircle.

Scale

Create a function, that takes an integer (radius of the circle) and returns the difference of the areas of the two squares.

Examples
squareAreasDifference(5) ➞ 50

squareAreasDifference(6) ➞ 72

squareAreasDifference(7) ➞ 98

Notes
Uses only positive integer parameters.
