This challenge has five miniature exercises to help practice proficiency in string slicing. Check the examples below for a visual indicator of how to slice the strings. Good luck!

Examples
const s = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
challenge1(s) ➞ "abcde"
// First 5 characters of the string.

challenge2(s) ➞ "vwxyz"
// Last 5 characters of the string.

challenge3(s) ➞ "zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba"
// All characters in the string from back.

challenge4(s) ➞ "fedcba"
// First 6 characters in the string (start with 6th character and go backwards).

challenge5(s) ➞ "tvxz"
// Take last 7 characters and only return odd positioned ones.

Notes
Check the Tests tab for more examples.
See the Resources tab for further information on learning string slicing.
You may use methods other than slice() as needed to complete some of the challenges.
All test cases follow the same slicing pattern as the above example.
