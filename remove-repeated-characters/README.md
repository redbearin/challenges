Create a function that will remove any repeated character(s) in a word passed to the function. Not just consecutive characters, but characters repeating anywhere in the input.

Examples
unrepeated("hello") ➞ "helo"

unrepeated("aaaaa") ➞ "a"

unrepeated("WWE!!!") ➞ "WE!"

unrepeated("call 911") ➞ "cal 91"

Notes
No more than two words will be passed.
Try to use new data type introduced in ES6.
Notice that a string is iterable.
