Given a sentence, create a function that replaces every "a" as an article with "an absolute". It should return the same string without any change if it doesn't have any "a".

Examples
absolute("I am a champion!!!") ➞ "I am an absolute champion!!!"

absolute("Such an amazing bowler.") ➞ "Such an amazing bowler."

absolute("A man with no haters.") ➞ "An absolute man with no haters."

Notes
Watch for uppercase letters as shown in example #3.
