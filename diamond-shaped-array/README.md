Create a function that returns an array that expands by 1 from 1 to the value of the input, and then reduces back to 1. Items in the arrays will be the same as the length of the arrays.

Examples
diamondArrays(1) ➞ [[1]]

diamondArrays(2) ➞ [[1], [2, 2], [1]]

diamondArrays(5) ➞ [[1], [2, 2], [3, 3, 3], [4, 4, 4, 4], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [4, 4, 4, 4], [3, 3, 3], [2, 2], [1]]
