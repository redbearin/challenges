The digit distance between two numbers is the total value of the difference between each pair of digits.

To illustrate:

digitDistance(234, 489) ➞ 12
// Since |2 - 4| + |3 - 8| + |4 - 9| = 2 + 5 + 5
Create a function that returns the digit distance between two integers.

Examples
digitDistance(121, 599) ➞ 19

digitDistance(12, 12) ➞ 0

digitDistance(10, 20) ➞ 1

Notes
Both integers will be exactly the same length.
All digits in num2 have to be higher than their counterparts in num1.
