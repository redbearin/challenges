Create a function that takes the values Dd (Dielectric Outer Diameter), Dc (Inner Conductor Diameter) and er (Dielectric Constant) and calculates the Coaxial Cable Impedance.

Examples
impedanceCalculator(20.7, 2, 4) ➞ 70.0

impedanceCalculator(5.3, 1.2, 2.2) ➞ 60.0

impedanceCalculator(4.48, 1.33, 2.2) ➞ 50.0
