Create a function that takes any non-negative number as an argument and return it with its digits in descending order. Descending order is when you sort from highest to lowest.

Examples
sortDescending(123) ➞ 321

sortDescending(1254859723) ➞ 9875543221

sortDescending(73065) ➞ 76530

Notes
You can expect non-negative numbers for all test cases.
