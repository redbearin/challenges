Given an array, create a function that returns an object detailing how many times each element was repeated. Sort the object by value in descending order.

Examples
countRepetitions(["cat", "dog", "cat", "cow", "cow", "cow"]) ➞ { cow: 3, cat: 2, dog: 1 }

countRepetitions([1, 5, 5, 5, 12, 12, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]) ➞ { 0: 6, 5: 3, 12: 2, 1: 1 }

countRepetitions(["Infinity", "null", "Infinity", "null", "null"]) ➞ { null: 3, Infinity: 2}

Notes
The array elements can be anything.
This version works when the keys are text (does not work with numbers).
