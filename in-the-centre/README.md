Given a string containing mostly spaces and one non-space character, return whether the character is positioned in the very centre of the string. This means the number of spaces on both sides should be the same.

Examples
isCentral("  #  ") ➞ true

isCentral(" 2    ") ➞ false

isCentral("@") ➞ true

Notes
Only one character other than spaces will be given at a time.
