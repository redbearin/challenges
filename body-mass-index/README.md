Body Mass Index (BMI) is found by taking your weight in kilograms and dividing by the square of your height in meters. The BMI categories are:

Underweight: <18.5
Normal weight: 18.5–24.9
Overweight: 25–29.9
Obesity: BMI of 30 or greater
Create a function that will accept weight and height (in kilos, pounds, meters, or inches) and return the BMI and the associated category. Round the BMI to nearest tenth.

Examples
BMI("205 pounds", "73 inches") ➞ "27.0 Overweight"

BMI("55 kilos", "1.65 meters") ➞ "20.2 Normal weight"

BMI("154 pounds", "2 meters") ➞ "17.5 Underweight"

Notes
1 inch = 0.0254 meter
1 pound = 0.453592 kilo
