A snail goes up the stairs. Every step, he must go up the step, then go across to the next step. He wants to reach the top of the tower.

Write a function that returns the distance the snail must travel to the top of the tower given the height and length of each step and the height of the tower.

Examples
totalDistance(0.2, 0.4, 100.0) ➞ 300.0
// Total distance is 300.

totalDistance(0.3, 0.2, 25.0) ➞ 41.7

totalDistance(0.1, 0.1, 6.0) ➞ 12.0

Notes
All given values are greater than 0.
Round answers to the nearest tenth 0.1.
Number of steps determined by tower height divided by stair height.
For the purposes of this exercise, the last step's length must be counted to complete the journey.
