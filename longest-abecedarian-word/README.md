An abecedarian word is a word where all of its letters are arranged in alphabetical order. Examples of these words include:

Empty
Forty
Almost
Given an array of words, create a function which returns the longest abecedarian word. If no word in an array matches the criterea, return an empty string.

Examples
longestAbecedarian(["ace", "spades", "hearts", "clubs"]) ➞ "ace"

longestAbecedarian(["forty", "choppy", "ghost"]) ➞ "choppy"

longestAbecedarian(["one", "two", "three"]) ➞ ""

Notes
All words will be given in lowercase.
If two abecedarian words have the same length, return the word which appeared first in the array.
