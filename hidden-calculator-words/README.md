At school, we used to play with our calculators and send each other secret messages. The trick was to enter a special number and turn the calculator upside-down. LOL ... I mean 707!

Given a number, create a function that converts it into a word by turning the integer 180 degrees around.

Examples
turnCalc(707) ➞ "LOL"

turnCalc(5508) ➞ "BOSS"

turnCalc(3045) ➞ "SHOE"
