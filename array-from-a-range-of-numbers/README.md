Create a function that returns an array of all the integers between two given numbers start and end.

Examples
rangeOfNum(2, 4) ➞ [3]

rangeOfNum(5, 9) ➞ [6, 7, 8]

rangeOfNum(2, 11) ➞ [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

Notes
start will always be <= end.
start and end are NOT included in the final array.
If start == end, return an empty array.
