Mubashir can talk with monkeys. You can also learn their simple language.

Create a function that takes a string txt and returns the string in monkeys language. You have to figure out their language from test cases.

Examples
monkeyTalk("Mubashir Hassan") ➞ "Ook ook."

monkeyTalk("Hello") ➞ "Ook."

monkeyTalk("Matt") ➞ "Ook."

monkeyTalk("Everyone") ➞ "Eek."

monkeyTalk("Edabit is Amazing") ➞ "Eek eek eek."
