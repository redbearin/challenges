Given the shortest side of a 30° by 60° by 90° triangle, find out the other two sides. Return the longest side and medium-length side in that order.

Examples
otherSides(1) ➞ [2, 1.73]

otherSides(2) ➞ [4, 3.46]

otherSides(3) ➞ [6, 5.2]

Notes
30 60 90 triangles always follow this rule: let's say the shortest side length is x units, the hypotenuse would be 2x units and the other side would be x * square root of 3.
In the Tests, the decimal is rounded to 2 places.
Return the values as an array.
