Write a function that takes coordinates of two points on a two-dimensional plane and returns the length of the line segment connecting those two points.

Examples
lineLength([15, 7], [22, 11]) ➞ 8.06

lineLength([0, 0], [0, 0]) ➞ 0

lineLength([0, 0], [1, 1]) ➞ 1.41

Notes
The order of the given numbers is X, Y.
This challenge is easier than it looks.
Round your result to two decimal places.
