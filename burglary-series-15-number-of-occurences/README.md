To further increase the statistical knowledge of your fight, count the number of times a certain adjective was used.

Given an object that contains several adjectives as values, return a new object where you count the ocurrences of each adjective.

Examples
countNumberOfOccurrences({
  a: "moron",
  b: "scumbag",
  c: "moron",
  d: "idiot",
  e: "idiot"
}) ➞ { moron: 2, scumbag: 1, idiot: 2 }


countNumberOfOccurrences({
  a: "moron",

  c:"moron"
}) ➞ { moron: 3 }


countNumberOfOccurrences({
  a: "idiot",
  b: "scumbag"
