Write a function that takes three string arguments (first, last, and word) and returns true if word is found between first and last in the dictionary, otherwise false.

Examples
isBetween("apple", "banana", "azure") ➞ true

isBetween("monk", "monument", "monkey") ➞ true

isBetween("bookend", "boolean", "boost") ➞ false

Notes
All letters will be in lowercase.
All three words will be different.
Remember that the string word is in the middle.
