Given a number, return a string which is formatted into US Dollars and cents!

Remember that:

You should round to two digits after the decimal point (even for integers).
Thousandths should be separated by commas.

Examples
dollaDollaBills(10) ➞ "$10.00"

dollaDollaBills(1000000) ➞ "$1,000,000.00"

dollaDollaBills(-314159.2653) ➞ "-$314,159.27"

dollaDollaBills(-56.99) ➞ "-$56.99"

Notes
There will be both negative and positive inputs.
