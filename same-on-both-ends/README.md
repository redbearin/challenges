Given a sentence, return the number of words which have the same first and last letter.

Examples
countSameEnds("Pop! goes the balloon") ➞ 1

countSameEnds("And the crowd goes wild!") ➞ 0

countSameEnds("No I am not in a gang.") ➞ 1

Notes
Don't count single character words (such as "I" and "A" in example #3).
The function should not be case sensitive, meaning a capital "P" should match with a lowercase one.
Mind the punctuation!
Bonus points indeed for using regex!
