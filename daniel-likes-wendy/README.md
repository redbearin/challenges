Your job is to figure out why Daniel likes Wendy, and some other girls. If you look at the Tests tab you'll notice that Daniel doesn't like many girls.

Create a function that returns whether he likes her true, or not false.

Examples
danielLikes("Imani") ➞ false

danielLikes("Margo") ➞ true

danielLikes("Sandra") ➞ false

Notes
Daniel likes his own name.
If you figure it out, prepare to say aha!
You get 500 girl names, enough to try different approaches.
Looking at the resources tab will give you a big hint.
