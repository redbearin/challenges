Create a function that takes two vectors as arrays and checks if the two vectors are orthogonal or not. The return value is boolean. Two vectors a and b are orthogonal if their dot product is equal to zero.

Examples
isOrthogonal([1, 2], [2, -1]) ➞ true

isOrthogonal([3, -1], [7, 5]) ➞ false

isOrthogonal([1, 2, 0], [2, -1, 10]) ➞ true

Notes
The two arrays will be of same length.
